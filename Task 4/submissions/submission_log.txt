Submission 1:

XGBoost - old testset & trainset, predict valence & arousal and calculate quadrants


Submission 2:

best_XGBRe_3_72_v_0_a_3_generic.jobli;  XGBoost; Quantile Transformer - Generic segment splitted testset, regression on valence & arousal and calc quadrants with no bias (v: 0, a: 3)


Submission 3:

Same model as above; Inference bias when calculating quadrant: v: -0.1, a: 3


Submission 4:

Same model as above; Inference bias when calculating quadrant: v: -0.13, a: 3



Submission 5 idea:
best_XGBRe_score_4_05.joblib with valence threshold changed by -0..1 -> if that does not increase score then try -0.03
